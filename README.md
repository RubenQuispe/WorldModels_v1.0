# WorldModels
An implementation of the ideas from this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10122.pdf

Code base adapted from https://github.com/hardmaru/estool


This repo. was created with an objective to learn Generative modeling in an enclosed Open-AI's environment with Evolutionary Strategy using the CMA-ES algorithm. There are some ongoing experiments for the next steps with different backbones and Attention units. 

## For full installation and run instructions:

* Create the anaconda environment file from requirement.txt
* Base frameworks in use are Keras-GPU(v2.3.1) and Tensorflow-GPU(v2.1)
* Run the notebooks for analysis of the experiments based on the weights and collected data
* For rendering the benchmarks, in OpenAI Gym environment:
```
python model.py car_racing --filename ./controller/car_racing.cma.xxxxx.best.json --render --final_mode
```
* The videos for some agents reaching some good scores are [here](https://github.com/cataluna84/WorldModels_v1.0/tree/master/videos)
* The complete instructions for rendering and benchmark *will be updated soon...*
